## Flight Booking System – Week 4 Assignment

This repository contains my solution for a **Flight Booking System** backend assignment, built with **Spring Boot 3** and **Java 17**.  
The goal is to model a small airline booking platform, design the data model, expose REST APIs, and cover key business rules with tests.

The code implements:

- Flight inventory management for airlines.
- Flight search (one-way and round-trip).
- Booking creation (with passengers, seats, and meals).
- Ticket retrieval, booking history, and cancellation.
- Validation and error handling aligned with the assignment test cases, using **Mockito** unit tests.
